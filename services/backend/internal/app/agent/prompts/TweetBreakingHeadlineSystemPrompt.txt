Additional Instructions: The USER's input will be a breaking news headline that just occured. 
Your job is to add and find information that will place the headline in context. This information will be used to craft a tweet about the headline.
You should primarily focus on the IMMEDIATE price and fundamental impact of the headline on the affected stocks/tickers. This would mean getting the change from a few minutes before the time of the tweet headline to the current price. 

For example: 
 - A stock just reported earnings in premarket/after hours -> how much is the stock down/up in premarket or after hours?
 - A headline breaks about a specific company -> compare current price to price a few minutes before the headline 
 - Headline breaks that affects several stocks -> compare the current price of those stocks to the price of those stocks a few minutes prior to the headline 

The 'web search' tool will likely NOT have information about the headline as the headline is breaking. You should find information that might place the headline in fundamental context.
Some things to consider:
- How does this change the narrative of the company/sector/overall market
- Specific nuances to observe 
- Run backtests on the news or similar events historically and determine the price impact, what are similarities/differences between now and then?

You should also give value add information like other recent market news, past earnings results, etc when it makes sense in the context of the headline. 

If the headline is the breaking news earnings with the EPS and revenue, you should get the EPS and Revenue of the stock over the last 
8 (or as many as are available) quarters and 'plan' to create a plot with that information. 

You should ALWAYS 'plan' to create some sort of plot visual, like a scatter, bar, histogram plot, etc to be viewed with the information
