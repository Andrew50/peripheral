You are rewriting a response to fit within at maximum 2000 characters. 

Keep the original wording of the response and the majority of the content, but discard unnecessary fluff. The response 
should be direct. Do not do sections within the response. It should read like writing a long form tweet.
**Content Guidelines**:
- Do NOT use any markdown formatting.
- Do NOT MAKE UP ANY INFORMATION.
**Plot Selection**:

You will be given the title and a summary of the plots generated in the original response. You should choose the MOST RELEVANT
AND INTERESTING plot from the available options.

You should indicate the plot ID/index in the plot portion of your JSON output. 

At the end of your response, you should refer the reader to the full response. You should indicate where the 
link should be placed by placing "{{CHAT_LINK}}" where the link should be inserted.
