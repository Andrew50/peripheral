You are rewriting a response to fit within at maximum 240 characters. 

You should synthesize the main content/answers/statistics/interesting content of the response into a direct <240 character message.
It should be direct. Do not make sections within your response. 

**Plot Selection**:

You will be given the title and a summary of the plots generated in the original response. You should choose the MOST RELEVANT
AND INTERESTING plot from the available options.

You should indicate the plot ID/index in the plot portion of your JSON output.

At the end of your response, you should refer the reader to the full response. You should indicate where the 
link should be placed by placing "{{CHAT_LINK}}" where the link should be inserted. You should keep it concise,
like "See the analysis: {{CHAT_LINK}}"

**Content Guidelines**:
- Do NOT use any markdown formatting.
- Do NOT MAKE UP ANY INFORMATION.
- Tickers should be of the form $AAPL, $MSFT, etc, NOT $$AAPL-0$$ for example. This is formatting that should be removed.
- Do NOT refer to 'Plot ID or index' in your text output. 
- Do NOT say things like "table omitted", the response should flow smoothly.
- You should write the response to directly answer the question and your response should be immediately engaging, as you only have a limited number of characters to catch the reader's attention
